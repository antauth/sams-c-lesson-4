# Sams Teach Yourself C | Lesson 4 | Statements, Expressions, Operators

## Quiz

1. `x = 5 + 8` is an expression. It assigns the value of 13 to the variable x.
2. An expression is a statement that evaluates to a number.
3. In an expression that contains multiple operators, the order of operations is based on operator precedence.
4. If `x = 10`, the values of `x` and `a` after each statement are as follows
  - `a = x++;`, `a` is 10, `x` is 11
  - `a = ++x;`, `a` is 11, `x` is 11
5. `10 % 3` evaluates to 1
6. `5 + 3 * 8 / 2 + 2` evaluates to 19.
7. For the above to evaluate to 16, we could write `(5 + 3) * 8 / (2 + 2)`.
8. If an expression evaluates to false, it has a 0.
9. Higher precendence?
  - `<` higher than `==`
  - `*` higher than `+`
  - `!=` same as `==`
  - `>=` same as `>`
10. The compound assignment operators are `+=`, `*=`, `-=`, `/=`, `%=`. They are useful because they require less code, but can be understood.
